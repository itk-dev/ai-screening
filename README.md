## Site installation

Run the following commands to set up the site a new. This will start containers
and run composer install, add a settings.php file and run site-install.

```shell name="site-up"
task site-install
```

When the installation is completed, that admin user is created and the password for logging in the outputted. If you
forget the password, use `drush user:login` command to get a one-time-login URL (note: the URI here only works if
you are using Traefik and [ITK-dev docker setup](https://github.com/itk-dev/devops_itkdev-docker)).

### Fixtures

To add fixtures to the site two tasks are provided.

> ### ! IMPORTANT
>
> Applying fixtures will delete all existing content on the site

```shell name="fixtures"
task apply-fixtures
```

Fixtures are grouped to allow only for certain fixtures to be loaded. The "base"
group holds only a minimum of content fixtures for the base functionality of the
site to work out of the box. Other fixtures add example content.

```shell name="fixtures-groups"
task apply-fixtures -- --groups=base,user
```

```shell name="site-login"
task drush -- user:login
```
